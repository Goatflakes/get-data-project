# get-data-project
Project for Getting and Cleaning Data, part of the JHU Data Science Specialization available on Coursera.org.

To perform the analysis, simply unzip the dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to the same directory as the run_analysis.R script file, then run run_analysis.R. This will create the summary data set as summary_data.txt.

Details of how the script works and the variable names it uses are in Codebook.md
